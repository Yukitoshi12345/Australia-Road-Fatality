## Results
Q1: What is the general trend for road fatalities in Australia over the past 30 years?

Q2: Anova test: Was the variance in States’ road fatalities month by month during covid lockdown following a similar variance?
Null Hypothesis: There was no variance across States’ road fatalities across the 3 years of Covid month by month.

Q3: Specifically in the last four years, is there a trend regarding various factors (speed limits, age, time of the day, day of the week, & type of road) as related to the number of fatalities?

Q4: Specifically in Victoria, did the introduction of booze buses and mobile speed radars have a significant impact on road fatalities?
